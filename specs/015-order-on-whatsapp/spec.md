## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer on the product details page, I want to be able to press an "Order on WhatsApp" button, which opens a modal with a form. After filling in my name, phone number, address, and any extra details, I can submit the form to store my order and format a WhatsApp message to be sent to a merchant.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer is viewing a product on the product details page, **When** they click the "Order on WhatsApp" button, **Then** a modal window appears with a form.
2. **Given** the order modal is open, **When** the customer fills in their name, phone number, address, and extra details and clicks "Submit", **Then** the system saves the order information.
3. **Given** the order has been successfully submitted, **When** the system processes the order, **Then** it formats a WhatsApp message to be sent to the merchant's number.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a customer submits the form with invalid or missing information?
- How does the system handle an error when trying to save the order to the database?
- What is the process if the WhatsApp message fails to send?
