# Feature Specification: Design a Login Page

**Feature Branch**: `006-i-want-you`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want you to design a login page. It must support username/email and password authentication."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to log in to the application using my username or email and password, so I can access my personalized content and features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a registered user is on the login page, **When** they enter their correct username and password, **Then** the system authenticates them and redirects them to their dashboard.
2. **Given** a registered user is on the login page, **When** they enter their correct email address and password, **Then** the system authenticates them and redirects them to their dashboard.
3. **Given** a user is on the login page, **When** they enter an incorrect username/email or password, **Then** the system displays an "Invalid credentials" error message.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user attempts to log in with an empty username/email or an empty password?
- How does the system handle repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or for the same account (e.g., account lockout, CAPTCHA)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a user interface for logging in.
- **FR-002**: The login form MUST include fields for `username or email` and `password`.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST authenticate a user based on a correct combination of their username/email and password.
- **FR-004**: Upon successful authentication, the system MUST grant the user access to their account and redirect them to the main application dashboard.
- **FR-005**: Upon failed authentication, the system MUST display a generic error message (e.g., "Invalid username or password") without specifying which part was incorrect.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **NFR-002**: The authentication process MUST be secure, protecting against common vulnerabilities. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there specific security standards to follow, such as rate limiting on login attempts or requirements for CAPTCHA?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an individual with an account. Key attributes include `username`, `email`, and a secure representation of their `password`.
