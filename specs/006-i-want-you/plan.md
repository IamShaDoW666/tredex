# Implementation Plan: Design a Login Page

**Branch**: `006-i-want-you` | **Date**: 2025-09-14 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-i-want-you/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   - If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This document outlines the plan to implement a login page with username/email and password authentication, using the `better-auth` library as specified.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5, Node.js 20
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15.5.2, React 19.1.0, TailwindCSS 4, `better-auth` 1.3.9, `better-sqlite3` 12.2.0
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the testing strategy for this feature? e.g., Jest, Playwright]
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js App Router)
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second authentication, p99 latency < 200ms.
**Constraints**: Must use `better-auth` for authentication. Responsive design.
**Scale/Scope**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many users are expected? What is the expected load on the authentication system?]

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (monolith Next.js app)
- Using framework directly? Yes, using `better-auth` directly.
- Single data model? Yes, a simple `User` model.
- Avoiding patterns? Yes, no complex patterns needed.

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No, this feature will be integrated into the existing Next.js app, following the established pattern.
- Libraries listed: `better-auth` for authentication.
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing**:
- Tests are implemented only when requested or deemed necessary.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the logging requirements for authentication events?]
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes, as per spec.

**Responsiveness**:
- Mobile-first approach planned? Yes, as per constitution.
- All UI components responsive? Yes, using ShadCN components.

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? N/A
- BUILD increments on every change? N/A
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

### Source Code (repository root)
The project follows a Next.js App Router structure, which is a single project.

**Structure Decision**: Sticking to the existing project structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research `better-auth` for username/email and password authentication.
   - Clarify security requirements (rate limiting, CAPTCHA).
   - Clarify logging requirements for authentication events.
   - Clarify testing strategy for authentication.
   - Clarify scale and scope of the feature.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Research is consolidated into `research.md`.

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - `User` entity with `username`, `email`, `password_hash`.

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - OpenAPI specification for the `POST /api/login` endpoint in `/contracts/`.

3. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Update `GEMINI.md` with `better-auth` usage.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/openapi.yaml`, `quickstart.md`, `GEMINI.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create tasks for creating the `User` model.
- Create tasks for creating the login API endpoint.
- Create tasks for creating the login page UI.
- Create tasks for integrating the UI with the API.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Models first, then API, then UI.

**Estimated Output**: 5-7 tasks in `tasks.md`.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |
