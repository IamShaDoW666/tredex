# Feature Specification: API Endpoints for Product and Category Data

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-api-endpoints`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Clarified  
**Input**: User description: "Add API endpoints for Categories and Products CRUD. Use Tanstack Query to fetch data. I want user to be able to view dynamic data from the database."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the website, I want to see the latest products and categories available, so that I can browse and shop for items based on real-time inventory.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the product grid should display items fetched directly from the database.
2. **Given** a user is browsing products, **When** they filter by a category, **Then** the system should show only products belonging to that category.
3. **Given** any user is interacting with the site, **When** they trigger a create action for a new product, **Then** it should immediately become visible to other users on the website.
4. **Given** any user deletes a category, **When** the action is confirmed, **Then** products formerly in that category should become uncategorized.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the database is unavailable? The system should display a user-friendly error message and perhaps show cached content if available.
- How does the system handle a request for a product or category that does not exist? It should return a standard "Not Found" response.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to retrieve a list of all product categories.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to create a new product category.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to update an existing product category.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to delete a product category.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to retrieve a list of all products.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to retrieve a single product by its unique identifier.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to create a new product.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to update an existing product.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide a public API endpoint to delete a product.
- **FR-010**: The frontend application MUST fetch and display product and category data from these API endpoints.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **NFR-002**: API responses for lists of products and categories should be paginated with a default page size of 20 items.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents an item for sale. Attributes include name, description, price, images, and category.
- **Category**: Represents a classification for products. Attributes include name and description.
