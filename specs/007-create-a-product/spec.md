# Feature Specification: Product Detail Page

**Feature Branch**: `007-create-a-product`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a product detail page. Users will click on a product card from anywhere on the application, it will redirect to this page. It will show the images, and description of the product. This page must be clean and concise so users can learn more about the product. Images must be visible correctly. Add sufficient animations. Also make sure it is tailored for mobile"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to view the detailed information and images of a product so that I can make an informed decision before purchasing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on a page with product cards, **When** the user clicks on a product card, **Then** they are redirected to the product detail page for that specific product.
2. **Given** a user is on the product detail page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the product's name, description, and images are displayed.
3. **Given** a user is on the product detail page, **When** interacting with the page, **Then** subtle animations enhance the user experience.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user navigates to a product detail page for a product that does not exist?
- How does the system handle missing product images or descriptions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to navigate from a product card to a product detail page.
- **FR-002**: The product detail page MUST display the product's images.
- **FR-003**: The product detail page MUST display the product's description.
- **FR-004**: The page layout MUST be clean and concise.
- **FR-005**: The page MUST incorporate animations to improve user experience.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents a product in the store. Key attributes include name, description, images, and price.
