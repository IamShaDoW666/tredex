# Tasks: Create a Product Detail Page

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-create-a-product/`

## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] **T001**: Create the directory `app/products/[id]`.
- [ ] **T002**: Create the file `app/products/[id]/page.tsx`.
- [ ] **T003**: Create the directory `components/feature/product-detail`.

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] **T004** [P]: Create the `ProductImageGallery` component in `components/feature/product-detail/ProductImageGallery.tsx`. It should accept an array of image URLs and display them. Use a client component (`"use client"`).
- [ ] **T005** [P]: Create the `ProductInfo` component in `components/feature/product-detail/ProductInfo.tsx`. It should display the product's name, price, and description.
- [ ] **T006** [P]: Create the `AddToCartButton` component in `components/feature/product-detail/AddToCartButton.tsx`. This will be a client component (`"use client"`) with a button to add the product to the cart.

## Phase 3: Data Integration & Page Assembly

- [ ] **T007**: In `app/products/[id]/page.tsx`, extract the `id` from the URL params and use the `useProduct(id)` hook to fetch the product data. Handle loading and error states.
- [ ] **T008**: Assemble the `ProductImageGallery` and `ProductInfo` components in `app/products/[id]/page.tsx` to build the page layout. Pass the fetched product data to these components.

## Phase 4: Navigation

- [ ] **T009**: Identify the `ProductCard` component (likely in `components/feature/landing-page/ProductGrid.tsx` or a similar location).
- [ ] **T010**: Modify the `ProductCard` component to wrap it in a Next.js `<Link>` component that navigates to `/products/[id]`, where `[id]` is the product's ID.

## Phase 5: Polish

- [ ] **T011** [P]: Add animations to the product detail page to enhance the user experience. This could include fade-in effects for the images or text.
- [ ] **T012** [P]: Conduct a thorough review of the product detail page across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure it is fully responsive.

## Dependencies

- **T001, T002, T003** must be completed before all other tasks.
- **T004, T005, T006** can be done in parallel.
- **T007** depends on **T002**.
- **T008** depends on **T004**, **T005**, and **T007**.
- **T010** depends on **T009**.
