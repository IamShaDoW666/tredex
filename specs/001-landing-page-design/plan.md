# Implementation Plan: Landing Page Design

**Branch**: `001-landing-page-design` | **Date**: 2025-09-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-landing-page-design/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a modern and minimalist e-commerce landing page for a new sneaker brand. The technical approach is based on Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, in accordance with the project's constitution. This is a front-end only feature and will not involve any database interactions. All product data will be mocked.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14.x, React 18.x, Tailwind CSS 3.x, ShadCN
**Storage**: N/A (No database required)
**Testing**: N/A
**Target Platform**: Web Browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application (Frontend)
**Performance Goals**: Fast load times (<2s)
**Constraints**: Responsive design for desktop and mobile
**Scale/Scope**: Single landing page

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (Frontend)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No, this is a page within the main application.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing**:
- Tests are implemented only when requested or deemed necessary.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? No
- Frontend logs → backend? No
- Error context sufficient? N/A

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? No
- BUILD increments on every change? No
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)

### Source Code (repository root)

# Option 2: Web application (when "frontend" + "backend" detected)

├── page.tsx
└── layout.tsx

└── ui/

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web Application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**: None
2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**: None
3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`: Done.

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`: Done.
2. **Generate API contracts**: None needed.
3. **Update agent file incrementally**: Skipped.

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each component → component creation task [P]
- Each page → page creation task [P]

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Dependency order: Components before pages
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 10-15 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
