# Tasks: Landing Page Design

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-landing-page-design/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

## Path Conventions
- Paths shown below assume web app structure.

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001: Create a new directory `components/feature/landing-page` for the new components.
- [ ] T002: Create a mock data file `lib/mock-data.ts` with an array of sneaker products based on the data model.

## Phase 3.2: Core Implementation
- [ ] T003: [P] Create the `Header` component in `components/feature/landing-page/Header.tsx`.
- [ ] T004: [P] Create the `Hero` component in `components/feature/landing-page/Hero.tsx`.
- [ ] T005: [P] Create the `ProductCard` component in `components/feature/landing-page/ProductCard.tsx`.
- [ ] T006: [P] Create the `ProductGrid` component in `components/feature/landing-page/ProductGrid.tsx`.
- [ ] T007: [P] Create the `Footer` component in `components/feature/landing-page/Footer.tsx`.
- [ ] T008: Assemble the landing page in `app/page.tsx` by importing and using the components created in the previous tasks. The `ProductGrid` component should be populated with the mock data from `lib/mock-data.ts`.

## Phase 3.3: Polish
- [ ] T009: [P] Style the `Header` component using Tailwind CSS for a modern and minimalist look.
- [ ] T010: [P] Style the `Hero` component with a large hero image and a prominent "Shop Now" button.
- [ ] T011: [P] Style the `ProductCard` component to display the sneaker's image, name, and price.
- [ ] T012: [P] Style the `ProductGrid` component to display the product cards in a clean grid layout.
- [ ] T013: [P] Style the `Footer` component with relevant links and information.
- [ ] T014: Ensure the entire landing page is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
