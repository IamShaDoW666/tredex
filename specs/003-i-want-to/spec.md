# Feature Specification: Mobile Navigation Toggle Menu

**Feature Branch**: `003-i-want-to`
**Created**: Wednesday, September 10, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to make a toggle menu for navigation in mobile view. Users must be able to toggle a navigation that comes from the side to view navigation links."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a mobile user, I want to easily access navigation links by toggling a side menu, so I can navigate the application efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing the application on a mobile device, **When** I tap the toggle menu icon, **Then** a navigation menu slides in from the side, displaying navigation links.
2. **Given** the navigation menu is open on a mobile device, **When** I tap outside the menu or tap the toggle menu icon again, **Then** the navigation menu slides out of view.
3. **Given** the navigation menu is open on a mobile device, **When** I tap a navigation link, **Then** the menu closes and I am directed to the corresponding page.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the user rapidly taps the toggle icon? (The menu should smoothly open/close without visual glitches.)
- How does the menu behave if the device orientation changes while it's open? (The menu should adapt to the new orientation or close gracefully.)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a visible toggle icon on mobile viewports.
- **FR-002**: Tapping the toggle icon MUST reveal a navigation menu that slides in from the side.
- **FR-003**: Tapping the toggle icon again or tapping outside the menu area MUST hide the navigation menu.
- **FR-004**: The navigation menu MUST display a list of navigation links.
- **FR-005**: Tapping a navigation link within the menu MUST navigate the user to the corresponding page and close the menu.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **NFR-002**: The toggle menu animation MUST be smooth and performant on mobile devices.
