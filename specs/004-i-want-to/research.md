# Research

This document summarizes the technical research for the filter, sort, and search functionality.

## Testing Framework

-   **Decision**: Use Jest with React Testing Library.
-   **Rationale**: This is the convention used in the project, as seen in existing test files. Next.js has built-in support for Jest.
-   **Alternatives considered**: None, as it's best to follow existing project conventions.

## Logging and Observability

-   **Decision**: Use `console.log` for basic logging during development.
-   **Rationale**: The project does not have a structured logging library in place. Introducing one is out of scope for this feature.
-   **Alternatives considered**: None.

## Pagination

-   **Decision**: Use infinite scroll.
-   **Rationale**: The user has requested this.
-   **Alternatives considered**: Traditional pagination.

## Error Handling

-   **Decision**: Follow the existing error handling patterns.
-   **Rationale**: The API has a consistent error handling mechanism. The frontend does not have custom error boundaries, which is acceptable for this feature.
-   **Alternatives considered**: None.
