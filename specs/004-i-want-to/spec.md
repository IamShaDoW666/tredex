# Feature Specification: Filter, Sort, and Search Functionality

**Feature Branch**: `004-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a filter, sort and search function in the landing page. The product grid component must have these options so users can search for specific types of products quickly. The UI must be neat and UX must be seamless"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user on the landing page, I want to be able to filter, sort, and search for products so that I can find the specific types of products I am interested in quickly and easily.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the landing page with a grid of products, **When** I enter "sneaker" in the search bar, **Then** I should see only products that match the search term "sneaker".
2. **Given** I am on the landing page with a grid of products, **When** I select the "sort by price: low to high" option, **Then** the products should be re-arranged from the lowest price to the highest price.
3. **Given** I am on the landing page with a grid of products, **When** I select the "filter by category: running" option, **Then** I should only see products from the "running" category.
4. **Given** I am on the landing page with a grid of products, **When** I adjust the price range slider to a specific range, **Then** I should only see products within that price range.
5. **Given** there are more products than the page size, **When** I scroll to the bottom of the product grid, **Then** more products should be loaded automatically (infinite scroll).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a search query returns no results? The system should display a clear "No products found" message.
- How does the system handle multiple filters being applied simultaneously? The system should display products that match all the selected filter criteria.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a search input field for users to search for products by name or keyword.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide options for users to sort products by Alphabetical (A-Z and Z-A), Price (low to high and high to low), and Date of creation (newest and oldest).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide options for users to filter products by product category, size, color, and brand.
- **FR-004**: The product grid MUST update dynamically in real-time to reflect the applied search, sort, and filter criteria without a full page reload.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST display a user-friendly message when no products match the applied criteria.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a way for users to clear all applied filters, sorts, and searches to return to the default product view.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide a price range slider for users to filter products by price. The slider's minimum and maximum values MUST be dynamically set to the lowest and highest product prices available in the current view.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST implement pagination for the product grid to handle a large number of products efficiently.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **NFR-002**: The search, sort, and filter operations should be highly performant and feel instantaneous to the user.
- **NFR-003**: The UI for the search, sort, and filter controls must be clean, intuitive, and seamlessly integrated into the landing page design.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents a product with attributes such as name, description, price, category, images, and brand.
- **FilterCriteria**: Represents the set of selected filter options (e.g., category: 'running', color: 'blue').
- **SortCriteria**: Represents the selected sort option (e.g., price ascending).
- **SearchQuery**: Represents the text string entered by the user in the search bar.
