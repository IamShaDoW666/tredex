# Implementation Plan: Filter, Sort, and Search Functionality

**Branch**: `004-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-12 | **Spec**: [specs/004-i-want-to/spec.md](specs/004-i-want-to/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The user wants to add filter, sort, and search functionality to the product grid on the landing page. This includes a search bar, sorting options (alphabetical, price, date), filtering options (category, size, color, brand), and a price range slider.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5, React 19, Next.js 15.5
**Primary Dependencies**: `next`, `react`, `mongoose`, `tailwindcss`
**Storage**: MongoDB (inferred from `mongoose`)
**Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library (inferred from existing tests and Next.js conventions)
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: API responses < 100ms, instantaneous UI updates
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: Hundreds of products, 20-30 concurrent users.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [1] (single Next.js app)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing**:
- Tests are implemented only when requested or deemed necessary.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? No (uses console.log)
- Frontend logs → backend? No
- Error context sufficient? The API provides basic error context (error message, status code). The frontend does not have custom error boundaries. This is sufficient for the initial implementation.

**Responsiveness**:
- Mobile-first approach planned? Yes
- All UI components responsive? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.0
- BUILD increments on every change? No
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2, as it is a web application.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research testing framework used in the project.
   - Research logging and observability practices in the project.
   - Clarify scale and scope of the feature.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Identify the testing framework and conventions used in the project."
   Task: "Investigate logging and observability patterns in the codebase."
   Task: "Ask the user to clarify the expected number of products and users."
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Product, FilterCriteria, SortCriteria, SearchQuery

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - GET /api/products with query parameters for filtering, sorting, searching, and price range.

3. **Update agent file incrementally**

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/products-api.md, quickstart.md, GEMINI.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create tasks for backend (API endpoint) and frontend (UI components).
- Backend tasks will involve updating the API to handle the new query parameters.
- Frontend tasks will involve creating and updating React components for the search bar, sort dropdown, filter panel, and price range slider.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Backend API tasks first, then frontend components.

**Estimated Output**: 10-15 tasks in tasks.md

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution
**Phase 4**: Implementation
**Phase 5**: Validation

## Complexity Tracking
N/A

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [ ] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
