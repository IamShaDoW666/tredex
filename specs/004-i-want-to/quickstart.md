# Quickstart

This document provides test scenarios for the filter, sort, and search functionality.

## User Stories

-   As a user, I want to be able to search for products so I can find what I'm looking for quickly.
-   As a user, I want to be able to sort products so I can view them in a preferred order.
-   As a user, I want to be able to filter products by various criteria to narrow down my choices.
-   As a user, I want to be able to filter products by a price range.
-   As a user, I want products to load continuously as I scroll.
