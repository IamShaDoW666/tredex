# Feature Specification: Add Related Products Component

**Feature Branch**: `009-add-a-related`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add a related products component. Place the component under the product detail section."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing a product detail page, I want to see a section of related products, so that I can discover other products that might interest me.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on a product detail page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a "Related Products" section should be displayed below the main product details.
2. **Given** the "Related Products" section is displayed, **When** there are related products available, **Then** a list of product cards for related products should be shown.
3. **Given** the "Related Products" section is displayed, **When** there are no related products available (or the API fails), **Then** the section should be hidden.
4. **Given** related products are displayed, **When** the user clicks on a related product, **Then** the user should be navigated to the detail page of the clicked product.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the API for related products fails? The section should be hidden.
- How are related products determined? Randomly selected products, excluding the currently viewed product.
- What is the maximum number of related products to display? 10.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a "Related Products" section on the product detail page.
- **FR-002**: The "Related Products" section MUST display a list of product cards.
- **FR-003**: Each product card in the "Related Products" section MUST be clickable and navigate to the respective product detail page.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST fetch related products based on the currently viewed product.
- **FR-005**: The "Related Products" section MUST support horizontal scrolling if the number of products exceeds the visible area.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **NFR-002**: The loading of related products MUST not significantly impact the perceived loading performance of the main product detail page.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents a product with attributes like `id`, `name`, `image`, `price`.
