## Technology Choices

### Form Management: React Hook Form

-   **Decision**: Use `react-hook-form` for managing form state and validation.
-   **Rationale**: It's a performant, flexible, and easy-to-use library for forms in React. It integrates well with validation libraries like Zod.
-   **Alternatives considered**: Formik. React Hook Form is generally considered more performant and has a smaller bundle size.

### Schema Validation: Zod

-   **Decision**: Use `Zod` for schema validation.
-   **Rationale**: Zod provides a simple and powerful way to define schemas and validate data. It can be easily integrated with `react-hook-form`.
-   **Alternatives considered**: Yup. Zod has better TypeScript support and is becoming the standard for new projects.

### UI Components: shadcn/ui

-   **Decision**: Use `shadcn/ui` for all UI components.
-   **Rationale**: This is a project requirement as per the constitution. It ensures a consistent and high-quality design.
-   **Alternatives considered**: None, as this is a mandatory requirement.

### Image Handling

-   **Decision**: For image uploads, we will use a standard file input. For image compression, a library like `browser-image-compression` can be used on the client-side before uploading. For image optimization, we will use Next.js's built-in Image component, which provides features like lazy loading and serving images in modern formats.
-   **Rationale**: This approach ensures a good user experience by reducing upload times and improving page load performance.
-   **Alternatives considered**: Server-side image processing. Client-side compression is preferred to reduce the load on the server.
