# Implementation Plan: Create Product Page

**Branch**: `011-create-product-page` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/milan/Desktop/Work/tredex/specs/011-create-product-page/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a new feature to allow admin users to create new products. The feature will be implemented as a new page in the admin dashboard, with a form for product details and image uploads. The implementation will use `react-hook-form` for the form, `zod` for validation, and `shadcn/ui` for components, adhering to the project's constitution.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, react-hook-form, zod
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads, responsive UI.
**Constraints**: Must use shadcn/ui components.
**Scale/Scope**: Single page for creating products.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (The main web application)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No, features are integrated into the main application.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing**:
- Tests are implemented only when requested or deemed necessary.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? No
- Frontend logs → backend? No
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Responsiveness**:
- Mobile-first approach planned? Yes
- All UI components responsive? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? No
- BUILD increments on every change? No
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

├── (admin)/dashboard/products/new/page.tsx # New product page

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - All unknowns have been resolved.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Research has been completed and documented in `research.md`.

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`.
2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements → `contracts/api.md`.
3. **Update agent file incrementally**: Skipped as no new technologies are introduced.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `contracts/api.md`, `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart).
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Implementation tasks to make the feature work.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI.
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files).

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |
