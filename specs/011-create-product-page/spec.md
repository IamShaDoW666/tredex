# Feature Specification: Create Product Page

**Feature Branch**: `011-create-product-page`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create product page for adding new products. Admin users must be able to add new products to the database. The page must have a form to fill the details and to upload images also."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (Admin), actions (add products, fill form, upload images), data (product details, images), constraints (Admin only)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'''d need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an admin user, I want to create new products by filling out a form with their details and uploading images, so that they can be listed for sale on the website.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as an admin user and am on the "Add Product" page, **When** I fill in all the required product details and upload at least one image, **Then** the new product should be created in the system and I should see a success message.
2. **Given** I am logged in as an admin user, **When** I try to submit the product form with missing required fields, **Then** I should see an error message indicating which fields are missing.
3. **Given** I am not logged in as an admin user, **When** I try to access the "Add Product" page, **Then** I should be redirected to a login page or a "permission denied" page.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an image upload fails mid-submission?
- How does the system handle invalid data types in the form fields?
- What happens if the user tries to create a product with a name that already exists?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a dedicated web page for creating new products.
- **FR-002**: The "Add Product" page MUST be accessible only to users with 'Admin' privileges.
- **FR-003**: The page MUST include a form for submitting new product information.
- **FR-004**: The form MUST include fields for the following product attributes: name, images, price, discountPrice, sizes, category, available, is_new, description, sex, and productType.
- **FR-005**: The form MUST allow for the upload of multiple product images with no limit on the number of images.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST validate the submitted product data before saving based on the schema in `model/productSchema.ts`.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST persist the new product information and its associated images to the database.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST display a confirmation message upon successful product creation.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST display a clear error message if product creation fails.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **NFR-002**: Uploaded images MUST be compressed to reduce file size before being stored.
- **NFR-003**: Product images MUST be loaded optimally on the front-end, for example, using lazy loading or a content delivery network (CDN).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents an item for sale. Attributes include name, description, price, images, and other relevant details.
