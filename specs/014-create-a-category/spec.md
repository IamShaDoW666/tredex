# Feature Specification: Create a category edit page

**Feature Branch**: `014-create-a-category`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a category edit page. It must be a clone of the category create page. But prefill the existing data of category to be edited. Make sure to follow the constitution.md file."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an admin, I want to edit an existing category so that I can update its details. The edit page should be pre-filled with the category's current information to make editing easier.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin is viewing the list of categories, **When** they click the "Edit" button for a specific category, **Then** they are navigated to the category edit page for that category.
2. **Given** the admin is on the category edit page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the form fields (e.g., name, description) are pre-populated with the existing data for that category.
3. **Given** an admin has modified the data in the pre-filled form and clicks "Save", **Then** the category's information is updated in the system, and the admin is redirected to the category list page.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an admin tries to navigate to an edit page for a category that does not exist? The system should display a "Category Not Found" error page.
- How does the system handle invalid data submission (e.g., an empty category name)? The form should display clear validation errors next to the invalid fields.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a user interface to edit an existing category.
- **FR-002**: The category edit page's URL MUST contain the unique identifier of the category being edited.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST pre-fill the edit form with the existing data of the category being edited.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow the user to modify the pre-filled data in the edit form.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST validate the submitted data to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., name is not empty).
- **FR-006**: Upon successful submission, the system MUST update the category's data in the database.
- **FR-007**: After a successful update, the system MUST redirect the user back to the list of categories.
- **FR-008**: If the category specified in the URL does not exist, the system MUST display a "Not Found" error.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Category**: Represents a product category. It has attributes such as a unique identifier, name, and description.
