# Research: Category Edit Page

## Decision

The category edit page will be implemented by cloning and adapting the existing product edit page located at `app/(admin)/dashboard/product/[id]/edit/page.tsx`. This approach ensures consistency with the established patterns for editing data within the application.

## Rationale

The user's request specified that the category edit page should be a clone of the category create page, and pre-fill existing data. The product edit page already implements this pattern of fetching data for a specific ID and pre-filling a form, making it an ideal template. Reusing this existing structure will reduce development time and maintain a consistent user experience.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Creating a new page from scratch**: This was rejected to avoid unnecessary work and to adhere to the existing design and architectural patterns of the application.
