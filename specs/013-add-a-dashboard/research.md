# Research for Product Edit Page

## Decision
The feature will be implemented using MongoDB as the database for product data. The existing `mongoose` library will be used for data modeling and interaction with the database.

## Rationale
The user has specified that MongoDB should be used for product data. The project already includes the `mongodb` and `mongoose` dependencies, so no new dependencies are required.

## Alternatives Considered
- **SQLite**: This was the previous choice, but the user has requested to use MongoDB instead.
