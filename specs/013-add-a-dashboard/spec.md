# Feature Specification: Product Edit Page

**Feature Branch**: `013-add-a-dashboard`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a dashboard/product/[id]/edit page. This page must be a clone of the create page. But hydrate the form with the existing data of the project. Then be able to modify and update it"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an admin, I want to edit an existing product so that I can update its information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin is on the product edit page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the form should be pre-filled with the existing product data.
2. **Given** an admin has modified the product data in the form, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the product information should be updated in the system.
3. **Given** an admin is on the product edit page, **When** they try to submit the form with invalid data, **Then** an error message should be displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an admin tries to edit a product that does not exist?
- How does the system handle concurrent edits by two different admins on the same product?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a page at `dashboard/product/[id]/edit`.
- **FR-002**: The edit page MUST be a clone of the create product page.
- **FR-003**: The form on the edit page MUST be hydrated with the existing data of the product being edited.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow an admin to modify the product data in the form.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST validate the modified data upon form submission.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST update the product in the database with the new data if validation passes.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST show a success message after a successful update.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST show an error message if the update fails.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST show an error message if the product to be edited is not found.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents the product being edited. Key attributes include name, description, price, category, brand, and images.
