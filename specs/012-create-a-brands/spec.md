**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a brands page. Include a datatable that displays all brands. Refer to the categories page for reference. I want the exact same CRUD operations."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an admin, I want to manage brands so that I can keep the product catalog organized.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the brands page, **When** I click the "Add Brand" button, **Then** a form appears to create a new brand.
2. **Given** I have filled out the new brand form, **When** I click "Save", **Then** the new brand appears in the brands datatable.
3. **Given** I am on the brands page, **When** I click the "Edit" button for a brand, **Then** a form appears to edit the brand.
4. **Given** I have edited the brand form, **When** I click "Save", **Then** the updated brand information appears in the brands datatable.
5. **Given** I am on the brands page, **When** I click the "Delete" button for a brand, **Then** a confirmation dialog appears.
6. **Given** I confirm deletion, **When** the brand is not associated with any products, **Then** the brand is removed from the datatable.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to delete a brand that is associated with products? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should be prevented with a message, but what should the message say?]
- How does the system handle creating a brand with a name that already exists? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should be prevented with a message, but what should the message say?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a page to display all brands in a datatable.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow admins to create new brands.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow admins to edit existing brands.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow admins to delete existing brands.
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent deletion of brands associated with products.
- **FR-006**: The datatable MUST support sorting and filtering.
- **FR-007**: The brands page SHOULD have a similar layout and functionality to the categories page.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Brand**: Represents a product brand. Key attributes: `name`, `description`.
