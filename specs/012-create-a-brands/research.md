# Research & Decisions for Brands Page

## Ambiguity Resolutions

### Deleting a Brand Associated with Products

*   **Decision**: Prevent deletion and show an error message.
*   **Rationale**: Deleting a brand associated with products would lead to data integrity issues and a poor user experience. The user should be informed that they need to re-associate the products to a different brand before deleting the brand.
*   **Message**: "This brand cannot be deleted because it is associated with existing products. Please re-assign the products to another brand before deleting."

### Creating a Brand with a Duplicate Name

*   **Decision**: Prevent creation and show an error message.
*   **Rationale**: Duplicate brand names would cause confusion and make it difficult to manage the product catalog.
*   **Message**: "A brand with this name already exists. Please choose a different name."

## Technology Choices

*   **Datatable**: ShadCN Datatable will be used to display the brands, as requested and to maintain consistency with the Categories page.
*   **Backend**: Next.js API routes will be used to handle the CRUD operations for brands.
*   **Database**: The existing database schema will be extended to include a "brands" table.

## Project Structure

*   **Decision**: The existing Next.js project structure will be used. The new page and its components will be created within the `app` and `components` directories, respectively. The API routes will be created within the `app/api` directory. This is in line with the constitution and the user's request to not use a frontend/backend split.
