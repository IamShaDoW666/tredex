# Implementation Plan: Create a Brands Page

**Branch**: `012-create-a-brands` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/012-create-a-brands/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a "Brands" page with full CRUD functionality. It will be similar in design and functionality to the existing "Categories" page, featuring a ShadCN datatable for brand management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, better-auth
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: N/A
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: N/A

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing**:
- Tests are implemented only when requested or deemed necessary.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? No
- Frontend logs → backend? No
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Responsiveness**:
- Mobile-first approach planned? Yes
- All UI components responsive? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? No
- BUILD increments on every change? No
- Breaking changes handled? No

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - All unknowns have been resolved in `research.md`.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - N/A

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - See `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - See `data-model.md`

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - API contracts will be defined implicitly by the Next.js API routes.

3. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - `GEMINI.md` has been updated.

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Implementation tasks to make the feature work.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A       | N/A        | N/A                                 |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
