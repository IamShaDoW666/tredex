# Research: Product Variant Selection

## State Management with Zustand

### Decision
We will use Zustand for managing the selected product variant state on the product detail page.

### Rationale
- The user explicitly mentioned using Zustand.
- It's a lightweight, simple state management library that fits well with React and Next.js.
- It avoids the boilerplate of more complex libraries like Redux.
- It uses a simple hook-based API.

### Alternatives Considered
- **React Context API**: While built-in, it can lead to performance issues with frequent updates as it re-renders all consumers. For a simple state like selected size, it might be overkill to set up a new context.
- **Redux**: Much more powerful, but also much more complex. It would be overkill for this feature.

## Best Practices for Zustand in Next.js
- Create a store to hold the state.
- Use the store's hook in the React components to access and update the state.
- The store can be defined in a separate file, for example, in the `hooks` directory.
