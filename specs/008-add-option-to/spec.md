# Feature Specification: Add Product Variant Selection

**Feature Branch**: `008-add-option-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add option to select product variants in the product detail page. Before buying a product, users must select there size of sneakers. Display the size from product data as a selectable list. Use zustand if needed for state management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user on the product detail page, I want to be able to select a size for the sneakers before I can add them to my cart, so that I can purchase the correct product variant.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on a product detail page for a sneaker with multiple sizes, **When** the user views the product information, **Then** a list of available sizes should be displayed.
2. **Given** a user has not selected a size, **When** the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, **Then** the button should be disabled or an error message should be displayed prompting them to select a size.
3. **Given** a user selects a size from the list, **When** the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, **Then** the product with the selected size should be added to the cart.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a product has no sizes? The size selection component should be hidden.
- What happens if a particular size is out of stock? The size should be disabled in the selection list.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a list of available sizes for a product on the product detail page.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST require the user to select a size before adding a product to the cart.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST store the selected size information when the product is added to the cart.
- **FR-004**: The "Add to Cart" button MUST be disabled until a size is selected, if the product has sizes.
- **FR-005**: The "Add to Cart" button MUST be enabled if the product has no sizes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents the sneaker. Key attributes: `name`, `description`, `price`, `sizes`.
- **ProductVariant**: Represents a specific size of a product. Key attributes: `size`, `stock_status`.
