# Feature Specification: Terms and Conditions Modal and Page

**Feature Branch**: `016-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to generate a terms and conditions modal. This modal must pop up when Terms and Condition link is pressed in the product details page before ordering. Also create a seperate page for terms and conditions. I will provide the content after the design"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user on the product details page, I want to view the terms and conditions before placing an order, so that I understand the rules and policies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the product details page, **When** they click the "Terms and Conditions" link, **Then** a modal with the terms and conditions is displayed.
2. **Given** the terms and conditions modal is open, **When** the user clicks the "close" button, **Then** the modal is dismissed.
3. **Given** a user navigates to the `/terms-and-conditions` page, **Then** the full terms and conditions are displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the content for the terms and conditions is not available? The system should display an error message.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a "Terms and Conditions" link on the product details page before ordering.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a modal with the terms and conditions when the link is clicked.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a way to close the modal.
- **FR-004**: System MUST have a dedicated page at `/terms-and-conditions` that displays the same content.
- **FR-005**: The content for the terms and conditions is located in `specs/016-i-want-to/terms.md`.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
