# Terms And Conditions

Before you make a purchase, please take a moment to review our terms and conditions.

## Parcel Opening Video

Please do not forget to make a parcel opening video. Take a full video from start to end without cut and pause. So if there is any damage or missing product, we can replace it. Without a parcel opening video, we will not be able to exchange the product. And without it, we cannot raise a complaint against the courier company.

## Return/Exchange Policy

In case of return/exchange, the customer needs to courier the parcel back within 2 days after receiving the parcel. Once we receive the parcel, the customer will get the any replacement. In case of exchange, the shipping charge is on the customer. The product will be checked before exchange. In case of any damage or item missing, we will send the parcel back to the customer.

## Shipping Charges

In case of exchange/return, all shipping charges will be paid by the customer. We are only responsible for the shipping charge if the parcel received by the customer is damaged. Shipping charges are non-refundable in any case.
